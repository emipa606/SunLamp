# Note: this mod is no longer under active development. I'll potentially come back to this in the future but for now I have my time filled with other things. Thank you for your understanding!


A mod that changes the default behavior of the sun lamp and hydroponic basins.

    Changes:

    * Sun Lamps
      - Increased light radius
      - Doesn't turn off at night
      - Outputs much more heat

    * Hydroponic Basins
      - Decreased cost, allowing 16 basins and a Sun Lamp from a single Geothermal Power Generator
      - Plants in basins don't rest at night
